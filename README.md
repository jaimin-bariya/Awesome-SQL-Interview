## Theory - Common Interview Questions

some of the most **common SQL theory questions** that are frequently asked in interviews. These questions test your understanding of SQL concepts, queries, optimization, and the relational database model.

### **Basic SQL Theory Questions**

1. **What is SQL?**
   - SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It is used to query, update, insert, and delete data from a database.

2. **What are the different types of SQL commands?**
   - **DML (Data Manipulation Language):** `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.
   - **DDL (Data Definition Language):** `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`.
   - **DCL (Data Control Language):** `GRANT`, `REVOKE`.
   - **TCL (Transaction Control Language):** `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`.

3. **What is a primary key?**
   - A **primary key** is a unique identifier for a record in a database table. It ensures that each record is unique and not null.

4. **What is a foreign key?**
   - A **foreign key** is a field in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table. It establishes and enforces a link between the data in two tables.

5. **What is normalization?**
   - **Normalization** is the process of organizing the attributes and tables of a database to minimize redundancy and dependency. It divides large tables into smaller ones and defines relationships between them.

6. **What is denormalization?**
   - **Denormalization** is the process of combining tables to reduce the complexity of queries and increase query performance, often at the cost of additional storage and redundancy.

7. **What are the types of joins in SQL?**
   - **INNER JOIN:** Returns only matching rows from both tables.
   - **LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN):** Returns all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right table.
   - **RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN):** Returns all rows from the right table and matched rows from the left table.
   - **FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN):** Returns all rows when there is a match in either left or right table.
   - **CROSS JOIN:** Returns the Cartesian product of both tables.

8. **What is an index in SQL?**
   - An **index** is a database object that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table. It works similarly to an index in a book, allowing faster access to specific rows.

9. **What is a subquery?**
   - A **subquery** is a query nested inside another query. It can be used in `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements to provide intermediate results for the main query.

10. **What is a view in SQL?**
    - A **view** is a virtual table based on the result set of a SQL query. It does not store data physically but presents the data from one or more tables in a structured way.

---

### **Intermediate SQL Theory Questions**

11. **What is a stored procedure?**
    - A **stored procedure** is a precompiled collection of SQL statements that can be executed as a unit. It can accept parameters and return results, improving performance and reusability.

12. **What is a trigger in SQL?**
    - A **trigger** is a set of SQL statements that automatically execute or fire when a specified event (like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) occurs on a table or view.

13. **What is the difference between `WHERE` and `HAVING` clauses?**
    - **WHERE** is used to filter records before aggregation (used in `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).
    - **HAVING** is used to filter records after aggregation (used with `GROUP BY`).

14. **What is the difference between `DELETE`, `TRUNCATE`, and `DROP`?**
    - **DELETE:** Removes specific rows from a table based on a condition and can be rolled back.
    - **TRUNCATE:** Removes all rows from a table without logging individual row deletions and cannot be rolled back.
    - **DROP:** Deletes a table, its structure, and its data permanently.

15. **What is the difference between `INNER JOIN` and `OUTER JOIN`?**
    - **INNER JOIN** returns only matching rows from both tables.
    - **OUTER JOIN** returns matched rows from both tables, plus unmatched rows from one or both tables (can be `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, or `FULL`).

16. **What are aggregate functions in SQL?**
    - Aggregate functions perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value. Common aggregate functions include `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`.

17. **What is a self join?**
    - A **self join** is a join where a table is joined with itself. This is useful for hierarchical or recursive relationships within the same table.

18. **What is a `CASE` statement in SQL?**
    - The **CASE** statement is used to add conditional logic to SQL queries. It is like an IF-ELSE statement that returns specific values based on conditions.

19. **What is the difference between `UNION` and `UNION ALL`?**
    - **UNION** combines the result sets of two or more queries and removes duplicates.
    - **UNION ALL** combines the result sets and keeps all duplicates.

20. **What is a composite key?**
    - A **composite key** is a primary key that consists of two or more columns to uniquely identify a record in a table.

---

### **Advanced SQL Theory Questions**

21. **What is ACID in database systems?**
    - **ACID** stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. It ensures that database transactions are processed reliably and protects against system failures.

22. **What is a transaction in SQL?**
    - A **transaction** is a sequence of SQL operations that are executed as a single unit of work. A transaction must be completed in full, or not at all (i.e., using `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK`).

23. **What is the difference between `JOIN` and `UNION`?**
    - **JOIN** combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column.
    - **UNION** combines the result sets of two or more queries into a single result set (only returns unique rows).

24. **What is a database normalization form (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF)?**
    - **1NF (First Normal Form):** Eliminates duplicate columns and ensures atomicity (each column contains unique values).
    - **2NF (Second Normal Form):** Eliminates partial dependencies, where non-key columns depend on only part of the primary key.
    - **3NF (Third Normal Form):** Eliminates transitive dependencies (non-key columns should not depend on other non-key columns).
    - **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form):** A stricter version of 3NF where every determinant is a candidate key.

25. **What is a deadlock in SQL, and how can it be prevented?**
    - A **deadlock** occurs when two or more transactions are blocked, each waiting for the other to release resources. It can be prevented by using transaction isolation levels and applying proper locking strategies.

26. **What is the difference between `RANK()` and `DENSE_RANK()`?**
    - **RANK()** assigns ranks with gaps when there are ties.
    - **DENSE_RANK()** assigns ranks without gaps, even when there are ties.

27. **What is a `WITH` clause (Common Table Expressions, CTE)?**
    - The **WITH** clause is used to define a temporary result set (CTE) that can be referenced within a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement.

28. **What are the different types of indexes in SQL?**
    - **Unique Index:** Ensures that no two rows have the same values in certain columns.
    - **Composite Index:** An index on multiple columns.
    - **Full-Text Index:** Used for text searching.
    - **Clustered Index:** The data is physically ordered on the disk based on the index key.
    - **Non-Clustered Index:** An index that is separate from the data and helps speed up queries.

29. **What is a surrogate key?**
    - A **surrogate key** is an artificial key used to uniquely identify a record, often implemented as an auto-incremented field.

30. **Explain the concept of sharding in databases.**
    - **Sharding** is a technique of horizontally partitioning a large database into smaller, more manageable pieces called **shards**. Each shard is stored on a separate server or cluster.

## **Additional SQL Theory Questions**

### **General SQL Concepts**

1. **What is a relational database?**
   - A **relational database** is a type of database that stores data in tables (relations). Each table consists of rows and columns, where each row represents a record, and each column represents an attribute of the record.

2. **What are database constraints, and why are they important?**
   - **Constraints** are rules enforced on data in a table to ensure data integrity. Common types of constraints include `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`, `DEFAULT`, `PRIMARY KEY`, and `FOREIGN KEY`.

3. **What is the difference between `CHAR` and `VARCHAR`?**
   - **CHAR** is a fixed-length string data type, while **VARCHAR** is a variable-length string data type. `VARCHAR` uses only as much space as needed, whereas `CHAR` always uses the defined length.

4. **What is referential integrity?**
   - **Referential integrity** ensures that relationships between tables are maintained consistently. It means that foreign keys in a table must correspond to valid primary keys in another table.

5. **Explain the concept of data consistency in a database.**
   - **Data consistency** means that the data stored in a database is accurate, reliable, and follows the defined rules or constraints at all times.

### **Indexing and Optimization**

6. **What are the different types of indexing in SQL, and how do they differ?**
   - **Clustered Index:** Data is physically ordered based on the index key.
   - **Non-clustered Index:** A separate structure that points to the data rows, allowing faster access.
   - **Unique Index:** Ensures that no two rows have the same values in the indexed column(s).
   - **Composite Index:** Indexing on multiple columns.

7. **How does SQL Server handle duplicate rows in a query result?**
   - By default, SQL removes duplicate rows in the query result unless the `DISTINCT` keyword is used. The `DISTINCT` keyword eliminates duplicate rows from the output.

8. **What are the potential problems caused by poor indexing?**
   - Poor indexing can result in slow query performance, increased I/O operations, and long query times, especially with large datasets. Too many indexes can also slow down write operations like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.

9. **What is query optimization, and why is it important?**
   - **Query optimization** is the process of improving the efficiency of a query by reducing its execution time. It is important to ensure that the database performs well even with large datasets and complex queries.

10. **What is the difference between a `UNIQUE` constraint and a `PRIMARY KEY`?**
    - Both **UNIQUE** and **PRIMARY KEY** ensure uniqueness, but a **PRIMARY KEY** also implicitly enforces `NOT NULL`. A table can have only one **PRIMARY KEY**, but it can have multiple **UNIQUE** constraints.

### **Transaction Management**

11. **What is a rollback, and when is it used?**
    - A **rollback** undoes all changes made by a transaction. It is used in cases of errors or when a transaction violates database rules.

12. **What are the different isolation levels in SQL?**
    - The **isolation levels** define the visibility of changes made by one transaction to other transactions. They are:
      - **READ UNCOMMITTED**
      - **READ COMMITTED**
      - **REPEATABLE READ**
      - **SERIALIZABLE**

13. **What is a deadlock, and how can it be resolved in SQL?**
    - A **deadlock** occurs when two transactions are waiting on each other to release resources, causing a standstill. It can be resolved by using a timeout, retrying the transaction, or implementing proper locking mechanisms.

14. **What is the difference between `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK`?**
    - **COMMIT** makes all changes made during the transaction permanent. **ROLLBACK** undoes all changes made during the transaction.

15. **What is a transaction log?**
    - A **transaction log** is a record of all the changes made to the database. It ensures that the database can be recovered to a consistent state after a failure.

### **Advanced SQL Concepts**

16. **What is a Materialized View?**
    - A **Materialized View** is a physical copy of a query result stored in a table format. Unlike regular views, materialized views store the result of a query for faster access and can be refreshed periodically.

17. **What is a recursive query?**
    - A **recursive query** is a query that refers to itself. In SQL, recursive queries are often implemented using `WITH` clauses (CTEs) to handle hierarchical data, like organizational charts or category structures.

18. **Explain the difference between `RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, and `DENSE_RANK()`.**
    - **ROW_NUMBER()** assigns a unique number to each row.
    - **RANK()** assigns ranks to rows with gaps if there are ties.
    - **DENSE_RANK()** assigns ranks without gaps, even with ties.

19. **What is a `WITH` clause (Common Table Expressions, CTE), and how is it different from a subquery?**
    - A **CTE** is a temporary result set that is defined within the execution scope of a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement. It is more readable and reusable than a subquery, which is nested within a query.

20. **What is the purpose of `EXPLAIN` in SQL?**
    - The `EXPLAIN` statement is used to analyze and display the execution plan of a query. It helps identify performance bottlenecks and optimize queries by showing how the SQL engine will execute them.

### **Normalization and Design Principles**

21. **What is the difference between 3NF and BCNF?**
    - **3NF (Third Normal Form)** ensures that there are no transitive dependencies, meaning non-key columns should not depend on other non-key columns. **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)** is a stricter version of 3NF, where every determinant must be a candidate key.

22. **What are candidate keys and alternate keys?**
    - **Candidate keys** are columns that can uniquely identify a record. A **primary key** is selected from the candidate keys. **Alternate keys** are the candidate keys not chosen as the primary key.

23. **What is an ER diagram?**
    - An **Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram** is a visual representation of the database structure, showing entities (tables), attributes (columns), and relationships between entities.

24. **What is the difference between `INSERT INTO` and `INSERT`?**
    - There is no difference between `INSERT INTO` and `INSERT` in SQL. Both are used to insert data into a table. The `INTO` keyword is optional.

25. **What are the various types of relationships in database design?**
    - The types of relationships include:
      - **One-to-One (1:1):** Each record in one table is related to one record in another table.
      - **One-to-Many (1:M):** Each record in one table can relate to multiple records in another table.
      - **Many-to-Many (M:M):** Multiple records in one table can relate to multiple records in another table.

### **Additional Optimization and Performance-Related Questions**

26. **What is query execution plan?**
    - The **query execution plan** is the strategy that the database query optimizer uses to execute a SQL query. It shows the steps involved in processing the query, including how tables are accessed, joined, and filtered.

27. **What is denormalization, and when would you use it?**
    - **Denormalization** is the process of combining tables to reduce the complexity of queries and improve performance, particularly in cases where read-heavy operations are more common than write operations.

28. **What are window functions, and how are they different from aggregate functions?**
    - **Window functions** perform calculations across a set of table rows that are related to the current row, without collapsing the result set like aggregate functions.

29. **What is sharding in databases, and how does it work?**
    - **Sharding** is a method of partitioning large databases into smaller, more manageable pieces called **shards**, which are stored across different servers to improve performance and scalability.

30. **What is the difference between a `LOCAL` and `GLOBAL` temporary table in SQL?**
    - A **LOCAL temporary table** is visible only to the session that created it and is dropped automatically when the session ends. A **GLOBAL temporary table** is visible to all sessions, but its data is session-specific.
