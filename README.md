## **L3: Expert Level (Complex Optimization, Recursive Queries, Advanced Data Manipulation)**  
- These are **expert-level** questions designed to challenge your skills with advanced SQL concepts
- including **performance optimization**, **complex joins**, **subqueries**, **recursive queries**, **CTEs with multiple joins**, and **advanced data manipulation techniques**.

#### Questions:
1. **Performance Optimization**: Write a query to find the total revenue (`quantityOrdered * priceEach`) for each `productCode` using **indexes** and optimized joins.  
2. **Subqueries**: Write a query to retrieve the `customerName` and `orderNumber` of customers who placed an order where the `orderDate` is later than the most recent order placed by `customerNumber = 103`.  
3. **Recursive Query**: Write a recursive query to find the **hierarchical structure of employees** (manager-subordinate relationship) in the `employees` table, starting with employee `employeeNumber = 1143`.  
4. **CTE with Multiple Joins**: Write a query to calculate the total revenue (`quantityOrdered * priceEach`) for each `productLine`, but only include `products` ordered in the last 6 months. Use a CTE to organize the query.  
5. **Window Function with Partitioning**: Write a query to calculate the **running total of revenue** (`quantityOrdered * priceEach`) for each `productCode` within each `orderDate` partition, sorted by `orderDate`.  
6. **Self-Join**: Write a query to find all employees who report to the same manager and list their `employeeNumber`, `firstName`, and `lastName`.  
7. **Query Optimization**: Write a query to find the top 5 customers who spent the most in total, optimizing the query by indexing appropriate columns and using joins to calculate the total revenue.  
8. **Handling NULLs**: Write a query to find the `customerName` and the `creditLimit` of customers who have not placed any orders (include customers with NULL `customerNumber` in the `orders` table).  
9. **Advanced Aggregation**: Write a query to calculate the **average order value** for each customer, but exclude customers who have placed less than 3 orders.  
10. **Join Multiple Tables**: Write a query to list the `employeeName`, `officeLocation`, and the total value of orders processed by the employee, joining the `employees`, `offices`, and `orders` tables.  
11. **Advanced Subquery**: Write a query to find the `productCode` and the total revenue generated for each product where the total revenue exceeds the average revenue of all products in the `orderdetails` table.  
12. **CTE with Window Functions**: Write a query to display the top 3 employees with the highest total `salary`, but include their total order value (join `employees` and `orders` using a CTE and window function).  
13. **Recursive CTE**: Write a recursive CTE to display the entire hierarchy of the sales representatives and their managers in the `employees` table.  
14. **Multi-Level Aggregation**: Write a query to find the average `salary` for each `jobTitle` in the `employees` table and then calculate the total average `salary` across all job titles.  
15. **Multi-Table Aggregation**: Write a query to find the `productLine` with the highest total revenue from both `orders` and `orderdetails` tables.  
16. **Dynamic Query Generation**: Write a query to dynamically generate the total order value for each `customerNumber`, where the calculation formula (`quantityOrdered * priceEach`) is customizable in the query.  
17. **Dealing with Data Inconsistencies**: Write a query to identify `customers` who have placed orders but have a `NULL` value for `creditLimit`.  
18. **Advanced Join and Grouping**: Write a query to retrieve the `orderNumber`, `orderDate`, and total order value for each order (use `orders` and `orderdetails`), but only include orders with products from a specific `productLine`.  
19. **Data Anomalies Detection**: Write a query to find any discrepancies between the order date (`orderDate`) and the `shippedDate` where the order was not shipped within 5 days of placing the order.  
20. **Query Optimization with Indexing**: Write a query to find the `customerName` and `total orders value` for each customer who placed orders greater than $5,000, optimizing the query performance by suggesting appropriate indexes.

---

### Explanation of Concepts Covered:
1. **Performance Optimization**: Focusing on indexes and optimized joins.
2. **Recursive Queries**: Useful for hierarchical data like employee-manager relationships.
3. **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**: Organizing complex queries, especially with multiple joins and aggregations.
4. **Window Functions**: Running totals, rankings, etc., with partitioning.
5. **Advanced Joins**: Self-joins, joins across multiple tables.
6. **Subqueries**: Writing nested queries for advanced filtering and calculation.
7. **Handling NULLs**: Dealing with missing data while fetching relevant results.
8. **Data Anomalies**: Identifying inconsistencies and fixing potential issues in business logic.

These expert-level questions will challenge you to think critically about query optimization, complex data retrieval, and efficient handling of large datasets. They will also help you prepare for interviews at top tech companies.
