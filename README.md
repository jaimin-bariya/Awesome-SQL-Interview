## Introduction

This repository serves as a practical guide for learning **SQL** and preparing for **SQL-related interview questions**. The questions range from basic SQL syntax to complex queries involving database optimization, transactions, joins, subqueries, and advanced SQL techniques.

## Repository Structure

- **/L0**: Basic SQL queries and concepts.
- **/L1**: Intermediate SQL queries covering joins, aggregation, and subqueries.
- **/L2**: Advanced SQL queries involving performance optimization, window functions, and more complex scenarios.
- **/Theory**: SQL theory questions including database design, normalization, transactions, indexing, etc.

## Categories of Questions

### L0: Basic SQL
- Questions related to basic SQL commands such as `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.
- Queries related to basic data manipulation and retrieval from simple tables.

#### Example Questions:
1. Write a SQL query to find the second highest salary from the `employees` table.
2. How do you fetch all records from a table where the `salary` is greater than 5000?

---

### L1: Intermediate SQL
- Queries that involve working with multiple tables, using `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and complex `WHERE` conditions.
- Introduction to subqueries, aggregate functions, and case statements.

#### Example Questions:
1. Write a SQL query to find the total salary of each department from the `employees` table, grouped by department.
2. Write a query to list employees who have a salary greater than the average salary of their department.

---

### L2: Advanced SQL
- Complex SQL queries including **window functions**, **common table expressions (CTEs)**, **transactions**, **stored procedures**, and **optimization techniques**.
- In-depth questions on database performance, indexing, normalization, and advanced joins.

#### Example Questions:
1. Write a SQL query to calculate the moving average of salary over the last 3 months for each employee.
2. How do you handle deadlocks in SQL?
